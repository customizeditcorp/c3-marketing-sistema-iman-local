## 🔄 WORKFLOW PASO A PASO {#workflow}

### **Para Manu - Ejecución Correcta:**

#### **PASO 1: Setup**
1. Abrir Gemini 2.5 Flash interface
2. Activar feature: **Nano Banana**
3. Verificar modo: **Image editing** (no "generation")

#### **PASO 2: Luis con iPad (Hero)**
1. Upload foto: `Screen_Shot_2025-11-04_at_6_21_38_PM.png`
2. Copiar/pegar: **Prompt #1 completo** (de arriba)
3. Set strength: **0.50** (punto medio recomendado)
4. **Enable face preservation: YES**
5. Generate
6. Validar checklist
7. Si no perfecto: ajustar strength ±0.05 y regenerar
8. Máximo 3 iteraciones

#### **PASO 3: Carlos Fondo**
1. Upload foto: `WhatsApp_Image_2025-11-04_at_11_59_26__1_.jpeg`
2. Upload referencia (opcional): Foto de Luis (para match background)
3. Copiar/pegar: **Prompt #2 completo**
4. Set strength: **0.65**
5. **Enable face preservation: YES**
6. Generate
7. Validar: ¿Fondo match con Luis? ¿Carlos 100% preservado?
8. Iterar si necesario (máx 3x)

#### **PASO 4: María (Si necesario)**
1. **Evaluar primero:** ¿Foto actual ya está perfecta?
2. Si SÍ: Usar original as-is
3. Si NO (cliente pide cambios):
   - Upload foto: `Screen_Shot_2025-11-04_at_6_22_56_PM.png`
   - Copiar/pegar: **Prompt #3**
   - Set strength: **0.25**
   - Generate minimal changes

### **VALIDACIÓN (Por cada imagen):**

**Checklist rápido:**
- [ ] ¿Persona reconocible? (cara original preservada)
- [ ] ¿Edición natural? (no se ve fake/composited)
- [ ] ¿Calidad alta? (sin artifacts, alta resolución)
- [ ] ¿Match con objetivo? (iPad visible / fondo correcto / etc)
- [ ] ¿Listo para landing? (composición, espacio para texto)

**Si 5/5 ✅ → Aprobar**  
**Si <5 → Iterar o escalar a Luis**

## 📊 COMPARACIÓN: CON vs SIN NANO BANANA

| Aspecto | Sin Nano Banana | Con Nano Banana |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Rostro Luis** | Genera persona nueva ❌ | Tu cara real ✅ |
| **Identidad** | Pierde identidad ❌ | 100% reconocible ✅ |
| **Control** | Bajo (IA decide) ❌ | Alto (preservación selectiva) ✅ |
| **Realismo** | Parece composición ❌ | Natural, integrado ✅ |
| **Uso** | Stock/genérico ❌ | Equipo real, auténtico ✅ |

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problema 1: Cara cambió**
**Causa:** Strength muy alto o Nano Banana no activado  
**Solución:**
- Bajar strength a 0.40
- Verificar Nano Banana enabled
- Re-generar

### **Problema 2: Edición se ve fake**
**Causa:** Lighting no match o shadows incorrectos  
**Solución:**
- Revisar prompt sección "Integration"
- Agregar más detalle en "shadows" specification
- Iterar con emphasis en "natural integration"

### **Problema 3: iPad/elemento agregado se ve flotando**
**Causa:** Physics/shadows no correctos  
**Solución:**
- Enfatizar en prompt: "realistic shadows", "natural perspective"
- Bajar opacity del elemento agregado 5-10%
- Regenerar con más detalle en "Physical Placement"

---

## 📞 SOPORTE

**Si algo no funciona después de 3 intentos:**
- Escalar a Luis con screenshots
- Explicar qué salió mal
- Mostrar settings usados (strength, etc.)

**No seguir intentando indefinidamente** - 3 iteraciones máximo por imagen.
